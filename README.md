# Simple-Budgeting-App-Client


### This is all codes for the front-end part, and this connects to the back-end part 
<br> 

## Currently it can only be used to perform add income and add expense only, then it will calculate the balance

### How to use:
    * Input username
    * Click Add Budget Button
    * Input the date, budget detail, and value
    * Submit
    * then you will only see some message on the screen saying either 'an expense added' or 'an income added'
    * If you click Show All budget, all your budget history will be shown, and you can't add any other budget unless you refresh it first

### This is made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only
<br>

### It makes calls to server, which code's are shown on my other repository: Simple-Budgeting-App-Server
